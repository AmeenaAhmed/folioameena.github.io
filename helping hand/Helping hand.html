                        <p> One in three people infected with COVID-19 lose their appetites enough to skip meals. It's most common in people over 65 where roughly four in ten people (43%) experience a loss in appetite at some point during their illness. Patients have access to fresh meals when meals are planned, making eating more convenient. Allergies to specific foods are also taken into account based on the data. The meals available offer a choice of different items that can be eaten slowly over time or all at once. Friends and family members can also place food orders for the patient. All of the meals are inspected before being served.<br> </p>

                        <p>Many covid patients in quarantine take a variety of medication to help them cope with the discomfort of their illness. A medication tab allows the user/friend/family to order both meals and medication at the same time. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical tab provides patients with a no-contact delivery option, which is more convenient for them.<br> </p>

                        <h3>NPS survey.</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>I decided to conduct an NPS survey at the end of the testing phase to be certian if the five users wold reccomend the product to there friends and family. The users were asked to rate the app from 1-10,then from the data collected they would be divided into theee groups,

                            3 out of 5 rated the application a (7) on the scale,
                            1 voted a (6)from the scale
                            and 1 voted a (9)

                            NPS is calculated from the percentage of Detractors  (who voted lower than 6)- the percentage of Promoters (who voted higher than 7) Results given below,

                            Even tho I have done alot of improvements to the application its clear from the NPS result that there is still more to be done, I am looking forward to upgrading this application in the future.
